# Gene Expression Analysis

This repository contains scripts and data for analyzing gene expression using time series analysis, regression modeling, and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).

## Files Included

- **gene_data.csv**: CSV file containing gene expression data. Columns include timestamps and expression levels of various genes.
  
- **time_series_data.py**: Python script for Task 1, including:
  - Loading and visualizing time series data of gene expressions.
  - Plotting time series for each gene against timestamps.

- **regression.py**: Python script for Task 2 and Task 3, including:
  - Implementing polynomial regression models to predict gene expression.
  - Evaluating models using RSS, AIC, and BIC criteria.
  - Implementing Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) for estimating posterior distributions of model parameters.
